<h1 align="center"  style="color:#EDEDED;">An Introduction to CEED</h1>
<div><p style="font-size: 20px; color:#EDEDED; ">
The three houses this year will function according to the CEED program. The CEED program allows each student to quantify their progress in the school year in terms of points, these points in turn will be added to that student's respect house. In "CEED", the C stands for Community building activities, the E is for Educational achievement, the next E stands for Extracurricular activities and the D is for Discipline. The program will map each student's abilities in all 4 aspects and in turn, provide a holistic picture of their performance in school. How points will be given to each student is explained in detail below. 
	</p>
	</div>
	<ul>
		<li ><span >C- Community building activities:</span></li>
<ul id="a" style="color:#EDEDED;">
	<li>Each community building activity organised by a house member would have 12 points granted to their house. </li>
	<li>Each student who partakes in the event, helping out logistically or in any other way, would have 0.5 points granted to their house.</li>

</ul>
		</br>
		<li ><span >E- Extracurricular Activities;</span></li>


<p style="font-size: 20px; ">Each activity, be it any sport, public speaking, science or an art contest, will be granted the same weightage in points. This is to ensure equal encouragement towards all the various ECAs, so that no student's talents go wasted.</p>
<ul id="a" style="color:#EDEDED;">
<li>Every 3rd position individual award would be granted 2 points. </li>

<li>Every 2nd position individual award would be granted 3.5 points. </li>

<li>Every 1st position individual award would be granted 7.5 points. </li>

<li>Every 3rd position team award would be granted 7 points. </li>

<li>Every 2nd position team award would be granted 10 points. </li>

	<li>Every 1st position team award would be granted 20 points.</li>
	</ul>
	</br>

		<li ><span >E- Excellence in Academics:</span></li>

<ul id="a" style="color:#EDEDED;">
<li>Each A/A* grade achieved by a student in their monthly/by-semester assessments will award their house 0.7 points. </li>

<li>Each B grade achieved by a student in their monthly/by-semester assessments will award their house 0.5 points. </li>

<li>A student levelling up a grade will be awarded with 0.2 points. </li>
</ul>
</br>
<li><span >D- Discipline:</span></li>


<ul id="a" style="color:#EDEDED;">

	<li>If a student causes any disciplinary issues or receives a formal warning letter, their house would be penalised. 
		</li>
	<li>A minor, but consistent divergence from the school policy on matters such as uniform, cleanness, behaviour and adherence to the COVID policies would cause the student to be fined, and their house to be docked with -0.75 points after every infringement. </li>
<li>A serious infringement of the school rules would entail a warning letter and consequently the student's respective house would be docked -5 points.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color:#EDEDED;">Lastly, the priority for all three Captain council positions will be given to those students who performed the best for their respective Houses i.e, won the most points for their House.

Good luck and Godspeed students!
